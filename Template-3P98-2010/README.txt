Welcome to PETE'S VOLCANO SIMULATOR 3000
=========================================
                COMMANDS
=========================================
Shooting Modes:

        Space bar = turn on constant stream of particles
        F (press) = Shoot one particle
        F (hold) = Rapid Fire
        E = Spray Mode
        M = Multiparticle Mode
        N = Random Spin
        P = shoot the camera out of the volcano
        G = Random Speed

Movement controls:

        W A S D = Move the volcano around
        x, y, z = rotate about x, y, or z axis
        Left mouse = rotate left faster
        Right mouse = rotate right faster

Display settings:

        V = toggle display version (dot, wireframe, textured)
        B = Toggle Backface Culling
        L = Toggle Gouraud Shading (To the volcano)

R = reset
q = quit



OPTIONAL FUNCTONALITY IMPLEMENTED:
1. SPRAY MODE: PRESS E TO ACTIVATE
	- increased the spread of the particles
	- are more likely to fly off the board

2. DEFINE LIGHTING
	- on by default (flat shading)
	- toggle to Gouraud shading by pressing L
	- since the particles are square, the difference will only be noticible on the volcano


3. ADD TEXTURES TO OBJECT
	- textures are on the particles, the volcano and the ground

4. ADD A MODE THAT LETS THE VIEWERS EYE BE A PARTICLE
	- activated by pressing P
	- camera will shoot out of the volcano

5. ADD A MODE THAT GIVES PARTICLES DIFFERENT COLOURS AND SIZES
	- pressing M (multiparticle mode) will enable this
	- there are now 3 different particles: small, medium and large
	- each particle size has a different texture

6. MOVE THE CANNON AROUND THE SCENE
	- use WASD to move the volcano (its an advanced volcano)

7. ADD SOUND FX
	- sound played when particle shot out of volcano
	- note: I created my own sound effect!
